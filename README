A Spotify automation tool that organizes your liked songs and creates custom playlists based on various sorting criteria.

To access the website and the app you need to recreate the app on your computer yourself.
The spotify allows to publish app only for companies, so I am not able to publish the app for the public.

Point 1 - Making the app in spotify.
To use the app you need to have to create a app on website called "Spotify for developers"
